       "['Winn-Dixie files for bankruptcy\\n\\nUS supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.\\n\\nWinn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (Â£980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m.\\n\\nAnalysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers\\' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie\\'s slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. The company\\'s new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. \"This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,\" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynch\\'s job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers. \"The real big issue is what\\'s going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sundance to honour foreign films\\n\\nInternational films will be given the same prominence as US films at next year\\'s Sundance Film Festival, with movies dominated by the theme of war.\\n\\nThe independent film festival will feature two new international cinema competitions, during its 20-30 January season in Utah. Forty-two films will debut at Sundance, including The Liberace of Baghdad by British director Sean McAllister. The prestigious festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981.\\n\\n\"We have always had an international component, but from next year they will enter a jury competition,\" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. \"We wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the American dramatic and documentary competitions.\" Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focus on countries and people under siege.\\n\\nThe Liberace of Baghdad features an Iraqi pianist hiding in a hotel as he waits for a visa, while Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya. Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide, while French-Israeli production Wall looks at Israel\\'s controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories. The 16 films competing in the new world cinema dramatic category include works from Germany, South Korea, Angola, China, Denmark and Australia.\\n\\nSeveral Hollywood stars feature in the festival\\'s American independent drama category, including Keanu Reeves and Benjamin Bratt. Vince Vaughn stars in quirky movie Thumbsucker while 21 Grams actress Naomi Watts plays a budding Hollywood actress in Ellie Parker. The top Grand Jury prize at this year\\'s festival went to low budget sci-fi thriller Primer, written and directed by Shane Carruth. Morgan Spurlock earned the directing award for Super Size Me, which became an international box office hit.\\n',\n",
       " 'Khodorkovsky ally denies charges\\n\\nA close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are \"false\".\\n\\nPlaton Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were \"absurd contradictions\" in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion. \"To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,\" he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.\\n\\nMr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the \"running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction\". The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country\\'s super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company\\'s effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas.\\n',\n",
